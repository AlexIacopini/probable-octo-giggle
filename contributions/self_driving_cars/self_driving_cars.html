Self Driving Cars

What are they?

A self driving car is any car that is driven and operated not by a human driver but by a computer program.

Why bother with them?

The large upshot that comes with the introduction of self-driving cars is the ability to remove human error and thus to hopefully minimise driving-related incidents. Currently one of the biggest concerns facing modern drivers and other road users is drunk driving. Driving under the influence of alcohol (or indeed most drugs) greatly inhibits reaction speed and judgement. For this reason drunk drivers pose a severe threat, not only to themselves but also to other people. Recently the UK government has attempted to crack down on drunk driving through several successful campaigns <<<link to drink driving campaign>>>. However, the use of self-driving cars would eliminate this concern entirely, as a typical computer is quite unaffected by alcohol. This ensures a consistent level of safety, ultimately higher than that of a human driver.

The concern

In theory, self-driving cars are a very safe mode of transport. However, many people would be uncomfortable using one. Part of this worry comes from the novelty of the concept. People are often suspicious of new technology and this will likely be a factor in limiting the trust people might have in self-driving cars. However, for the most part, the main reason why consumers would choose not to use a self-driving car may be unease at the lack of control that a user has whilst 'driving' the car. This is the same factor that leads to a fear of flying in many people.
