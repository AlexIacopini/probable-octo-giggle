Smart Fridges

What are they?

The internet refrigerator, colloquially known as a smart fridge, is a fridge
that tracks the amounts of products it contains and knows when to stock up on
more of an item. Smart fridges have been around, at least as an idea, since
the late 90s, and was first launched into reality in June 2000.
