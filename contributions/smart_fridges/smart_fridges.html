Smart Fridges

What are they?

The internet refrigerator, colloquially known as a smart fridge, is a fridge that tracks the amounts of products it contains and knows when to stock up on more of an item. Smart fridges have been around, at least as an idea, since the late 90s, and was first launched into reality in June 2000.

How do they work?

Typically the fridge will keep a track of the stock it has through the use of barcodes to scan food as it comes in and out of the fridge.
