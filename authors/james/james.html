		<h1>James</h1>
		<p>Linux advocate by day, asleep at a sensible time by night, James Goodall has spearheaded the creative side of this project, using css and bootstrap to bathe each webpage in a glorious mint green colour, also known as celadon. The term celadon refers to a form of glaze used in ancient Chinese from as early as 25AD. An interesting feature of the glaze is the existence of many tiny cracks, which gives a piece of pottery a unique effect. Fortunately, James, through his tireless efforts has ensured that our code contains no such cracks but is as perfect and unblemished as it could be. Oh and he also set up the github repository so there's that too I suppose.
